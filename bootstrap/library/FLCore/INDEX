FLSRs                   'FLSRS' is a class that extends 'list' through
                        'FLlst' but implements a set of features that
                        give a little bit more structure to list
                        objects. The elements of 'FLSRs' must all be of
                        class 'FLSR'. It implements a lock mechanism
                        that, when turned on, does not allow the user
                        to increase or decrease the object length.
