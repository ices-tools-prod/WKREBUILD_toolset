- The FLom class now derives from a parent virtual class FLo.
- A FLombf class contains slots @biols, of class FLBiols, and @fisheries, of
  class FLFisheries.
- mp() now class a goFish method for each of the FLo-derived classes: FLom and
  FLombf.
- oem modules need to take an FLo-based object as input.
- tracking is handled by methods dealing with stock being of either FLStock or
  FLStocks class.
- Added performance(FLombf) to be called by performance(FLmse).
- merge(FLQuant, data.table) method to assemble output tables.
- debugf() method for FLom and FLombf, applies to projection slot.

 USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

- Argument indicators in performance() has been renamed statistics, to clarify
  the role of that element. Indicator is now restricted to refer to empirical
  metrics obtained from operating model observations that are used to provide
  indications of changes in stock status. For example, catch rates by fleet.
- dims(FLombf) returns unit and season data.

 mse 2.1

 NEW FEATURES

- metrics method for FLmse, calls metrics(FLStock).

- Accessors for FLoem@observations and @deviances now accept a subsetting name,
  as in observations(FLoem, "stk").
- Inputs to tunebisect() are now checked for coherence and dimensions.
- fwd(FLom) calls FLasher::fwd(stock(FLom), sr(FLom), ...).
